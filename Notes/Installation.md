**What is a Database?**
- A structured set of computerized data with an accessible interface.
- A collection of data.
- A method for accessing and manipulating data.

**Database vs Database Management System(DBMS):**
- A DBMS that allows us to interface with that database. SO it's just the code or the program that does the talking to 
  our database for us. So we talk to our DBMS and it talks to the database.


**SQL:** SQL is the language we use to "talk" to our databases.

**Relational Databases:**
- MySql
- SQLite
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle
- etc All use SQL.
- There is an SQL  standard that all databases has to implement, but sometimes it may deviate a little.

Note: What makes databases unique are the features they offer, not the language.

**Command to Log in cmd:** mysql -u user_name -p
